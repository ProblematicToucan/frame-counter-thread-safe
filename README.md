Lack of memory management, thread safety, and efficiency.

## Potential Memory Management Issues
- **Reused Frame Buffers:** The `Frame` class is designed to wrap around a byte buffer (`_rawBuffer`). However, `_rawBuffer` is being directly referenced in `FrameGrabber`, and once the frame data is copied from `IntPtr`, it can become stale if `_buffer` in `FrameGrabber` is modified again.
- **Dispose Handling:** While Frame implements `IDisposable`, it doesn’t clear or reset `_rawBuffer` to null when disposed, which could lead to accessing old or invalid memory if `GetRawData()` is called after disposal. A `Dispose` method should ideally release any resources or set fields to `null` to prevent reuse of disposed objects.

## Thread-Safety Concerns
- **Queue Access in Multiple Threads:** The `_receivedFrames` queue in `FrameCalculateAndStream` is modified by `HandleFrameUpdate` (presumably called on the native thread) and accessed in `OnTimerElapsed` (from the `Timer` event thread). Accessing a `Queue` from multiple threads without synchronization could lead to data corruption or runtime errors. Consider using a `ConcurrentQueue` instead of `Queue`, which is thread-safe for concurrent reads and writes.
- **Handling of FrameReceived Callback:** Since FrameReceived is likely called on a separate thread, make sure any operations here (like enqueueing frames) are safe and don’t introduce concurrency issues.

## Code Efficiency
- **Timer Usage and Frame Rate Mismatch:** The `Timer` in `FrameCalculateAndStream` is set to a 30 FPS interval (every 33ms). If frames are added to `_receivedFrames` at a different rate, there could be either a backlog or unnecessary processing of repeated frames. If the native frame capture rate is already 30 FPS, the timer may be redundant, and processing could be handled directly when a frame is added to `_receivedFrames`.
- **Frame Processing:** Currently, each frame is dequeued and processed individually, calculating the arithmetic mean pixel value. If the camera feed is high resolution, this loop could be costly.

## Error Handling and Validation
- **`FrameReceived` Without Validation:** In `FrameReceived`, there’s no check to ensure that frame is a valid pointer or that `width` and `height` are within expected bounds. Always validate input data before using it, especially with pointers, to prevent potential memory issues.
- **Exception Handling in Timer Callback:** If an exception is thrown in `OnTimerElapsed` (e.g., due to an empty queue or disposed frame), it could crash the application or cause the timer to stop without warning. It would be wise to wrap the body of `OnTimerElapsed` in a try-catch block to ensure robust error handling.

## General Code Improvements
- **Implementing a Frame Pooling System:** Since frame processing happens frequently, allocating a new `Frame` object for every new frame can be costly. Instead, consider reusing `Frame` objects by implementing a simple object pooling pattern.
- **Avoid Direct Disposal of Frames in `FrameReceived`:** In `FrameReceived`, Dispose is called immediately after the frame is enqueued. This could invalidate `_rawBuffer` while it’s still needed. Let `FrameCalculateAndStream` handle disposing `Frame` objects after processing.
